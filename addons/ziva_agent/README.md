## Why Ziva Wins Over Every Other Godot AI Tool

- **Insane Project Awareness** - Ziva doesn’t just read one file. It understands your **entire game** - every scene, script, resource, texture, animation, signal connection. Context game over.
- **Next-Level Scene & Code Creation** - Players, inventories, procedural dungeons, shaders, UI systems, dialogue trees, save/load, multiplayer sync - described once, built perfectly.
- **Instant Debugging Superpower** - Crashes? Weird physics? Null instances? Ziva reads the console, the stack trace, your code - then **fixes it** while explaining why it was broken.
- **Refactors Like a Senior Architect** - Turns spaghetti into clean, signal-based, ECS-ready architecture on command.
- **Privacy on Steroids** - Your game, data stored locally on your machine, your IP - never used to train anything. Ever. (Deep technical proof → [AI coding tools and code privacy](https://ziva.sh/blogs/ai-coding-tools-and-code-privacy))
- **Works with the Best Brains** - Claude, GPT, Gemini, Kimi, Grok whatever you throw at it - watch magic happen.
- **Windows • macOS • Linux** - Godot 4.2+ - zero excuses.
